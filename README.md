# Dotfiles

![vim-example](vim-example.png)

My Arch Linux compatible user dotfiles.
They were originally based on the dotfiles of
[lukesmithxyz](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/voidrice).
This being some time, hundreds of commits and my personalized version of
[larbs](https://github.com/Tiyn/larbs) ago, they are now quite different.

## Default Programs

The following are some of the main programs that are installed by using this install script.

- Operating System: `Arch Linux`
- Window Manager: `dwm`
- Audio Server: `pipewire`
- Shell: `zsh`
- Terminal Emulator: `st`
- File Manager: `vifm`
- Application Launcher: `dmenu(_run)`
- Status Bar: `dwmblocks`
- Notification Service: `dunst`
- Text Editor: `neovim`
- Reader: `zathura`
- Browser: `zen-browser`
- Lockscreen: `slock`

All requirements and recommendations get installed by my version of LARBS.
To take a look at all the software it installs look at the
[progs.csv](https://github.com/Tiyn/larbs/blob/master/progs.csv)  in my LARBS repository.

## Migration of my Dotfiles to Other System

- set alias in .bashrc: `alias config='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'`
- clone this repository: `git clone --bare https://github.com/Tiyn/dotfiles $HOME/.dotfiles`
- optional: backup old files:

```sh
mkdir -p .config-backup && \
config checkout 2>&1 | egrep "\s+\." | awk {'print $1'} | \
xargs -I{} mv {} .config-backup/{}
```

- checkout changes: `config checkout`
- ignore untracked files: `config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no`
- pull current setup: `config pull`
- finish setup for vim:
  - open vim

The step containing commenting out is needed because the colorscheme has
problems being not available and disrupts the further process of the plugin
installation.

## Ignore Local Changes to Config Files

If you need to make local changes to config files that are not to be pushed
run `config update-index --skip-worktree <file>` to stop git from showing them
having changes.

## Hotkeys

There are various shortcuts and hotkeys used in this version. Included in my build are the following.
[Dwm](https://github.com/tiyn/dwm)s and [st](https://github.com/tiyn/st)s hotkeys can be found in their repositories.

## Additional Configs

Additional configs (and for example firefox plugins) can be found in my
[wiki](https://github.com/tiyn/wiki).

## Additional Information

This section contains information regarding special configurations that will be enabled or
available by using these dotfiles.

### Audio Setup

This configuration features settings and profiles for
[easyeffects](https://github.com/tiyn/wiki/blob/master/wiki/linux/easyeffects.md).
Additionally to the flat profile there are also various profiles for headphones.
They mostly target to achieve curve similar to the
[harman curve](https://github.com/tiyn/wiki/blob/master/wiki/linux/audio.md#headphone-audio-profiles).

The following list matches the headphones and in-ear monitors to the base equalizer used.

- Beyerdynamic DT 1770 (Velour): [AutoEQ](https://github.com/tiyn/wiki/blob/master/wiki/linux/audio.md#sound-server)
- TANGZU Wan'er S.G: [AutoEQ](https://github.com/tiyn/wiki/blob/master/wiki/linux/audio.md#sound-server)
- Tin HiFi T2 Plus: [AutoEQ](https://github.com/tiyn/wiki/blob/master/wiki/linux/audio.md#sound-server)
